# 👋 Hi, I'm Hussein Shihap

🎓 I'm a second-year Computer Science student at **Beirut Arab University**, deeply passionate about programming, creative problem-solving, and building impactful real-world applications.

💻 **Technologies & Skills**:
- Languages: Java, C++, Python
- Libraries: NumPy
- Web Development: Full Stack (currently in training)

🚀 I'm actively enrolled in a high-quality Full Stack Web Development course, constantly expanding my skills beyond the academic environment. I’m self-driven, growth-oriented, and continuously striving to improve as a developer.

📘 I'm actively working on personal and academic projects to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios.  
One example is **CodeBiblio**, a library management system I built from scratch — from concept to implementation — and later presented as a group project.

🌍 I'm based in **Lebanon** and of **Syrian nationality**. I speak English fluently, and I take pride in my strong **leadership**, **influence**, and **effective communication** skills.
